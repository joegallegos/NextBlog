Last night was the first night I decided to go out and try and take some astro pics here in Colorado. To my good luck, it was a nice clear new moon night. I made the mistake of not paying attention to where exactly I was setting up and ended up setting up right under a cable that cut some time off of one of my target.

Overall I ended up getting some more data for The North America Nebula and California Nebula. I think if the wind lets up tonight I might try and get some more data on the Jellyfish nebula or try and get some more data on the Rosette Nebula. We will see.
