Today is a day that I am very bittersweet about. I love going home and visiting my family and friends, but with all the Covid stuff going on, it's really pushed my trip length. I normally come into Denver on or the day before Thanksgiving and stay till Christmas day, but with how bad Covid is right now, I had to move my trip up. 

The covid numbers in Texas are astronomical and show no real signs of slowing down at the moment, which is why I think my flights kept getting changed over and over and over again.

Lets hope for a quick safe flight and a good start to my Denver trip.
