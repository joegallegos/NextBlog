So over the past couple of days I've been looking over better ways of making this blog better. I think I've settled with still using Next as a frontend, but adding GhostCMS as the backend. From everything I've looked over it looks to be a pretty good mix and there are some videos out there that I can get some help from.

## Astrophotography Update
Tonight I am working on a couple of targets. First, I'm going to give NGC 7822 (AKA the question mark nebula) a shot. With my set up I have too much range to get the whole thing in the picture, but I really just want the main part of it anyways. Second target, which I will spend most the night on, is the California Nebula again. Really just wanting to get some more data on it so I can try and pull more details and clean up the noise. Skies are looking nice and clear right now, so lets hope that they continue throughout the night.
