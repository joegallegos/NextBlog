Last night was pretty cloudy and tonight is supposed to be cloudy (I'll double check as it gets closer to night) so I decided to rework my Andromeda shot and edit my Rosette Nebula thats just been sitting in my SSD.

# Andromeda rework

Since I don't flatten my images and save in multiple stages, it was pretty easy to work some more data out of this image. I really wanted to get more of the blues out so thats what I focused on.

I like how it turned out, and will probably retire the image at this point. Once I get some new gear I'll probably come back and start fresh on it.

# Rosette Nebula

I've shot the Rosette before but only had an hour of data on it. This time I still didn't get much, only 2 hours but its cleaner noise wise. If you look at the nebula in the right way, you can see it resembles a skull, (which, fun fact, Avenged Sevenfold used it as an album cover), which I wanted to show off as well.

Black and white version, rotated, heavily cropped and heavy contrast.

I'm happy with the images for the little amount of data I have on it. I'll come back to it at some point, again, hopefully with better gear.
