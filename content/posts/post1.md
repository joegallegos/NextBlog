Hello there and welcome to my blog. I have no idea what I am going to do with it, but figured it would be a good chance to learn more about Next.js. My current situation is I'm looking for work, which is a bit of an issue at the moment with Covid still going on. I'm hoping that adding some new things to my github, cleaning up some of my projects and cleaning up resume it will help out in the long run

Thanks for stopping by, if I remember, I'll keep this updated.
