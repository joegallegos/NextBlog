Yesterday I decided I needed a day away from the computer so that ment no coding, no image processing nothing. Just relax, take a nap and watched some tv, play xbox and hangout with the roommates. It was a nice day, but back to the grind.

Last night I decided to try and snap some pictures of Andromeda. Although the moon was at 99%, I think I still got a decent one, not exactly "thrilled" by it, but an improvement over my last.

As for today, I'm not too sure What I'm going to work on. Going to try and maybe come up with something new.
