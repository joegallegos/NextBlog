Yesterday I decided I needed a day away from the computer so that ment no coding, no image processing nothing. Just relax, take a nap and watched some tv, play xbox and hangout with the roommates. It was a nice day, but back to the grind.

Last night I decided to try and snap some pictures of Andromeda. Although the moon was at 99%, I think I still got a decent one, not exactly "thrilled" by it, but an improvement over my last.

Info for astrophotography nerds like myself:
- 65x120 subs
- 15 darks frames
- 31 flats frames
- 30 bias frames
- Stacked, stretched, 180&deg; flip, light pollution and star color correction in AstroPixelProcessor.
- Gradient, star size, star color boost, levels, curves, slight HDR tone, highpass filter, noise and sharpen in Photoshop.
- Crop and Export with signature in Lightroom.

As for today, I refactored this site so markdown should work as intended and a little less bulky. Still feel I have a few more tweaks I want to make to it, but I'm happy for now.
