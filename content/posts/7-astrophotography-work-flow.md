I have been asked a couple times from some friends about how I get my astrophotoghry photos to look like they do, so I thought I would try and do a very condensed workflow video about it.

Now, if you know me, you know I suck at explaining.... basically anything, and hate doing videos but I wanted this to be as decent as it could be. So, if you are interested in the video, you can check it out

information for the stack:

### Gear

- Canon 300mm F/4L
- Sky-watcher Star Adventurer

### Technical

- 136x120 second subs
- Stacked, Stretched, Rotated, Light pollution and Star color correction in AstroPixelProcessor.
- Gradient, Levels, Curves, StarKiller (Starizon action), Starnet++, Saturation layer, More curves, Bring stars back into image, Slight HDR tone, Noise and Sharpen in Photoshop

I'll be sure to take snapshots along the way the next time I process an image to give a full walkthrough of my process, but for now, I think the video will suffice.
