- Yesterday I decided I needed a day away from the computer so that ment no coding, no image processing nothing. Just relax, take a nap and watched some tv, play xbox and hangout with the roommates. It was a nice day, but back to the grind.

- Last night I decided to try and snap some pictures of Andromeda. Although the moon was at 99%, I think I still got a decent one, not exactly "thrilled" by it, but an improvement over my last.

- As for today, I'm not too sure What I'm going to work on. Going to try and maybe come up with something new.
