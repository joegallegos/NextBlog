- Today I decided to try and work on some more `Next.js` stuff. I came up with an idea that I feel could have potential if I wanted to put more time into it.

- For some background, I have been doing photography for 25 years at this point. I recently (2 months-ish) got into doing astrophotography and part of doing that means I have to pay attention to the weather more. Depending on if its cloudy, rainy etc.. it determines if I setup my camera or not.

- So the idea I had was to make something that I can just quickly glance at and get an overview for if I should start planning for a night out shooting the stars, or plan on staying in for the night. I have a rough idea of what I want with it and so far its in a decent spot but there is a lot more I want to do with it.

- First off, I have the location(zip code) hard coded in for my location. At some point, I'd like to have an input that other users can use to find their locations info.

- There is more I'd like to do and more I'd like to learn to maybe trigger more ideas, but for today, this will work for now. More work on it tomorrow.
