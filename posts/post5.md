- This year for Halloween its nothing new for me, stay home and just hang out. I used my other small site [Worth Going Out?](https://wgo.joegallegos.dev/) to see how the weather and cloud coverage would be and decided to snag a couple of time lapses and a few shots of the full moon. You can see one of them I published [on my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joegallegosphotography/50553546142/in/dateposted/).

- Nothing else planned for tonight and tomorrow I haven't thought ahead yet, maybe a new project if I can think of anything.
